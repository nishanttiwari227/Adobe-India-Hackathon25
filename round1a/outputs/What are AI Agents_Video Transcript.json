 "title": "Video Transcript What are AI Agents? 2024 will be the year of AI agents. So what are AI agents? And to start explaining that, we have to look at the various shifts that we're seeing in the field of generative AI. And the first shift I would like to talk to you about is this move from monolithic models to compound AI systems. So models on their own are limited by the data they've been trained on. So that impacts what they know about the world and what sort of tasks they can solve. They are also hard to adapt. So you could tune a model, but it would take an investment in data, and in resources. So let's take a concrete example to illustrate this point. I want to plan a vacation for this summer, and I want to know how many vacation days are at my disposal. What I can do is take my query, feed that into a model that can generate a response. I think we can all expect that this answer will be incorrect, because the model doesn't know who I am and does not have access to this sensitive information about me. So models on their own could be useful for a number of tasks, as we've seen in other videos. So they can help with summarizing documents, they can help me with creating first drafts for emails and different reports I'm trying to do. But the magic gets unlocked when I start building systems around the model and actually take the model and integrate them into the existing processes I have. So if we were to design a system to solve this, I would have to give the model access to the database where my vacation data is stored. So that same query would get fed into the language model. The difference now is the model would be prompted to create a search query, and that would be a search query that can go into the database that I have. So that would go and fetch the information from the database, output an answer, and then that would go back into the model that can generate a sentence to answer, so, \"Maya, you have ten days left in your vacation database.\" So the answer that I would get here would be correct. This is an example of a compound AI system, and it recognizes that certain problems are better solved when you apply the principles of system design. So, what does that mean? By the term \"system\", you can understand there's multiple components. So, systems are inherently modular. I can have a model, I can choose between tuned models, large language models, image generation models,but also I have programmatic components that can come around it.",

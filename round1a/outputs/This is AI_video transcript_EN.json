 "title": "This is AI: Presented by IBM video transcript This is AI, presented by IBM, starts now. Artificial intelligence is here whether we like it or not. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, robots... It's exciting also very frightening. Some of the biggest names in science and technology warn about the dangers of using artificial intelligence to make weapons. The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race. This is really like the scariest problem for me. That's where we need the regulators come in and say: Hey guys you'll need to pause and make sure this is safe. Artificial intelligence has the potential to solve all of the most difficult problems of today and tomorrow. AI will impact everything. There's nothing it won't touch. It Is a renaissance. It is a golden age. Robots let people do more than they could by themselves. What do we want to use AI for--to solve problems, to be more prosperous, and to be healthy. That has to be its purpose. With artificial intelligence, the computers start to learn, to think, to re-write, to design their own programs. AI can give us the ability to hear better, to see better, to give us new capacities that we never had before. You can pair a human doctor plus an artificial intelligence system to create new drugs that humans in a lab might not have considered before. You could see incredible expansion in lifetimes. This all sounds very Star Trek, but, believe me, that's going to happen. The question is are we going to be smart enough to make choices as to what we want as a society. Scientists are creating AI today and setting the course for a new tomorrow. How AI changes our lives now and in the future is up to us. We're at this fork in the road where if we get things right with AI we can help life flourish like never before and really bring out the best of us. This is AI,  presented by IBM.",
